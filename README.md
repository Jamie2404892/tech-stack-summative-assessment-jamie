My choice of tech stack in this project were HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front end languages. For the backend i used wampsever, php & SQL for the database.

The overall scope of the project was to develop an easy to use website to facilitate AI tools. Some of the goals were to have a login system, search tool and customisable profiles. Users would be able to post their own AI tools for others to see and recieve feedback in the forms of likes/dislikes. There would also be a verification system for official websites so that users could identify which were the reliable ones.

Installation is simple. Install the latest wampserver package and follow the websites installation instructions, add the zip into the server folder and adjust any mySQL passwords as needed.

Front end requirements are to have a modern aesthetic that is simple to navigate. It should be very intuitive to use so that it does not turn away potential new users. It will host basic user profile creation and editing along with the ability to post your own AI websites and recieve feedback. It will also inlude a tool page that you can access all the websites from, including a search engine which filters through the names and tags. Some websites are additionally equipped with verified badges to show their strong reputations.

On the back end there needs to be handling of all user data, such as the passwords and profile data. Additionally all AI websites and their reviews will need to be stored and easily accessed by all users.

The timeline for developing these features is as follows: Project documentation → 27th sept - 14th Nov General research → 27th Sept - 29th Sept Design of frontend → 29th sept - 3rd Nov Implenting front end features → 31st sept - 7th Nov Development of backend → 7th - 14th Nov

User Guide Users are expected to press the get started button on the main home page. This will take them to the tools page, here they will have access to all of the AI websites. However they will not be able to upload their own websites without being logged in. This leads them to the sign up button in the top right of the page. This takes them to a seperate page where they fill out their details. Once complete they are then taken to the profile page where they can add additional customisation such as a profile picture or bio. All navigation is simple as there is a task bar at the top to making switching to different sections simple.

One of the biggest ethical considerations faced in designing a website is the handling of the data. This is because if the privacy is breached it can mean a serious fine. Another consideration is making sure we dont use copyrighted content like images or icons without permission. One ethical concern related to the AIs we provide is whether the site is morally correct.

A few of the risks that I have analyzed is the technical failure. This could mean servers are not avaliable causing the website to go down. Additionally there are reputational risks if we recommend a unethical AI because of a user uploading it. Financially there is a risk that the website could lose funding, especially as there has been no planned way to monetise it.

In the future if I were to scale the website I would consider ways of monetising the website. I could also embed some AI's directly into the website such as an AI assistant to act as questions and a search engine. This would be very on theme and could be a good look.
